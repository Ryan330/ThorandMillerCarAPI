## Development Process

### -Concept-
After viewing the many APIs that were listed in the project assignment documentation, I decided to branch out and find something that interested me a bit more. Being a guy that loves cars, I decided to work on a concept that not only fulfilled the project assignment requirements, but also references cars. The concept of this application is to allow the user to select any vehicle's year and model from any manufacturer to return images and data for said vehicle.

### -Web Design and API Implementation-
In the beginning of such projects, a very important goal in my opinion is to create a web design that features what the user will eventually interact with in the future once the project is complete. Why? Because it ultimately makes the development process much more simplistic to have a visualization of what to work on and test throughout the development process.

The most important task when working with APIs is to create the connection between your coding and the API's available data. We created all of the necessary variables that targeted our future plans between the JavaScript and HTML such as selecting queries, manipulating CSS classes, and appending the necessary HTML tags.

### -Project Challenges-
Unfortunately, the API is not a free source which led us to facing limitations which we have to work around. The API's data is also listed in a fairly awkward format which forced us to go outside of the usual process of data retrieving. Because of this, the overall process of completing the API implementation lasted longer than expected. Though thanks to our hard, persistent workflow, we still managed to meet our project deadline.
